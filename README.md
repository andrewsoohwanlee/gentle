ðŸ‘‹ Heyo! [**Gentle**](https://gentle.app/) is a mobile app where you write requests for kindness and reply to others. It's cute, anonymous, and moderated. It was my ([Andrew Lee](https://andrewlee.design/)'s) solo project for three months in early 2020.

The app shutdown in May 2020, and I decided to release _everything_. All code is available under an MIT license. You are welcome to fork it, remix it, take its parts, etc.

## Folder Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ admin-dashboard            # Basic moderation dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ firebase                   # All "server" code for Gentle â€” Firestore rules, indexes, and cloud functions
â”œâ”€â”€ flutter-app                # The mobile app code (created in Flutter)
â””â”€â”€ landing-page               # The Next.js site hosted on gentle.app
```

Each folder has its own `README` with relevant information.

## On the _Gentle_ Brand

While Gentle's design and code are now publicly available, I am unlikely to transfer the [gentle.app](https://gentle.app/) domain name or endorse any product based on this work.

You are welcome to reuse the assets I created for Gentle, but I recommend you choose a different product name to differentiate yourself. Not a requirement for licensing by any means, but it's probably a good move to set expectations of new ownership.

## Need help?

I am no longer actively supporting Gentle. Helping people interested in using this work is not my priority.

You are welcome to reach me at [hi@andrewlee.design](mailto:hi@andrewlee.design), but I may be slow to respond and/or decline your request.
