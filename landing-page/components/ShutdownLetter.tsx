          , the creator of Gentle. If you're not familiar, Gentle is a mobile
          app where you write requests for kindness and reply to others. It's
          cute, anonymous, and moderated. It's been my side project for three
          months.

        <p>
          In the past few weeks, around 6,000 people have joined Gentle's iOS
          beta. It's been a privilege to have so much interest, praise, and
          support for my work. I got lucky with the beta launch (see{" "}

        <h2>Unfortunately, I've decided to stop working on Gentle</h2>
        <p>
          What on earth happened? To be transparent: I realized that I can't
          commit the time and effort to keep Gentle going. There are a few
          reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The pandemic has convinced me to prioritize my full-time job. I
              believe it's where I can do the most good right now.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Moderation has taken a toll on my well-being, and I don't have
              time to commit to community building.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I've had some personal happenings that need my attention more.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I'm sorry to anybody disappointed by my decision. I hope you
          understand. üôè

        <h2>What will happen to Gentle?</h2>
        <p>
          Bringing in helpers isn't a solution because I'm not available to
          coordinate it. I'm also not interested in selling Gentle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've decided to shut down the beta and release the source code for the
          project. This includes the Flutter app, Firebase server code,
          moderation dashboard, landing page, and my{" "}

        <p>
          Sharing the project's files is no substitute for keeping it going (or
          maintaining it as open-source), but I hope it inspires you. Remix it.
          Take its parts. Build things that bring kindness into the world,
          because we sure need more of it.
